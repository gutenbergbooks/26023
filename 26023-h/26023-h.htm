<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three lectures collected in this volume were
prepared without any intention of publication.
They were delivered for the purpose of drawing
attention to the links which connect the proposal
for a League of Nations with the past, to the difficulties
which stand in the way of the realisation
of the proposal, and to some schemes by which
these difficulties might be overcome. When it
was suggested that the lectures should be brought
before the public at large by being issued in book
form I hesitated, because I was doubtful whether
the academic method natural to a University lecture
would be suitable to a wider public. After consideration,
however, I came to the conclusion that
their publication might be useful, because the
lectures attempt to show how the development
initiated by the two Hague Peace Conferences could
be continued by turning the movement for a League
of Nations into the road of progress that these
Conferences opened.</p>

<p>Professional International lawyers do not share
the belief that the outbreak of the World War and
its, in many ways, lawless and atrocious conduct
have proved the futility of the work of the Hague
Conferences. Throughout these anxious years we
have upheld the opinion that the progress initiated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
at the Hague has by no means been swept away
by the attitude of lawlessness deliberately&mdash;'because
necessity knows no law'&mdash;taken up by Germany,
provided only that she should be utterly defeated,
and should be compelled to atone and make ample
reparation for the many cruel wrongs which cry
to Heaven. While I am writing these lines, there
is happily no longer any doubt that this condition
will be fulfilled. We therefore believe that, after
the map of Europe has been redrawn by the
coming Peace Congress, the third Conference ought
to assemble at the Hague for the purpose of
establishing the demanded League of Nations and
supplying it with the rudiments of an organisation.</p>

<p>How this could be accomplished in a very simple
way the following three lectures attempt to show.
They likewise offer some very slight outlines of a
scheme for setting up International Councils of
Conciliation as well as an International Court of
Justice comprising a number of Benches. I would
ask the reader kindly to take these very lightly
outlined schemes for what they are worth. Whatever
may be their defects they indicate a way out
of some of the great difficulties which beset the
realisation of the universal demand for International
Councils of Conciliation and an International Court
of Justice.</p>

<p>It is well known that several of the allied Governments
have appointed Committees to study the
problem of a League of Nations and to prepare a
scheme which could be put before the coming Peace
Congress. But unless all, or at any rate all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
more important, neutral States are represented,
it will be impossible for an all-embracing League
of Nations to be created by that Congress; although
a scheme could well be adopted which would keep
the door open for all civilised States. However,
until all these States have actually been received
within the charmed circle, the League will not be
complete nor its aims fully realised. Whatever
the coming Peace Congress may be able to achieve
with regard to a scheme for the establishment of
the League of Nations, another&mdash;the third&mdash;Hague
Peace Conference will be needed to set it going.</p>

<p class="author">L. OPPENHEIM.</p>

<p><small>P.S.&mdash;While this Preface and volume were going through
the Press, Austria-Hungary and Germany surrendered, and
unprecedented revolutions broke out which swept the
Hapsburg, the Hohenzollern, and all the other German
dynasties away. No one can foresee what will be the
ultimate fate and condition of those two once mighty
empires. It is obvious that, had the first and second
lectures been delivered after these stirring events took place,
some of the views to be found therein expressed would
have been modified or differently expressed. I may ask
the reader kindly to keep this in mind while reading the
following pages. However, the general bearing of the arguments,
and the proposals for the organisation of the League
of Nations and the establishment of an International Court
of Justice and International Councils of Conciliation, are
in no way influenced by these later events.</small></p>

<h3>THE LECTURE</h3>

<p>I. Dr. Whewell, the founder of the Chair of International
Law which I have the honour to occupy
in this University, laid the injunction upon every
holder of the Chair that he should 'make it his
aim,' in all parts of his treatment of the subject,
'to lay down such rules and suggest such measures
as may tend to diminish the evils of war and finally
to extinguish war between nations.' It is to comply
with the spirit, if not with the letter, of this injunction
that I have announced the series of three
lectures on a League of Nations. The present is
the first, and in it I propose to treat of the Aims
of the League. But, before I enter into a discussion
of these aims, I should like to point out that I have
no intention of dealing with the question whether
or no a League of Nations should be founded at
all. To my mind, and probably to the minds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
most of you here, this question has been satisfactorily
answered by the leading politicians of all
parties and all countries since ex-President Taft
put it soon after the outbreak of the World War;
it suffices to mention Earl Grey in Great Britain
and President Wilson in America. In giving these
lectures I propose to draw your attention, on the
one hand, to the links which connect the proposal
for a League of Nations with the past, and, on the
other hand, to the difficulties with which the realisation
of the proposal must necessarily be attended;
and also to the ways in which, in my opinion, these
difficulties can be overcome.</p>

<p>There is an old adage which says <i>Natura non
facit saltus</i>, Nature takes no leaps. Everything in
Nature develops gradually, step by step, and
organically. It is, at any rate as a rule, the same
with History. History in most cases takes no leaps,
but if exceptionally History does take a leap, there
is great danger of a bad slip backwards following.
We must be on our guard lest the proposed League
of Nations should take a leap in the dark, and
the realisation of proposals be attempted which
are so daring and so entirely out of keeping with
the historical development of International Law
and the growth of the Society of Nations, that there
would be great danger of the whole scheme collapsing
and the whole movement coming to naught.</p>

<p>The movement for a League of Nations is sound,
for its purpose is to secure a more lasting peace
amongst the nations of the world than has hitherto
prevailed. But a number of schemes to realise this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
purpose have been published which in my opinion
go much too far because they comprise proposals
which are not realisable in our days. You know
that not only an International Court of Justice
and an International Council of Conciliation have
been proposed, but also some kind of International
Government, some kind of International Parliament,
an International Executive, and even an
International Army and Navy&mdash;a so-called International
Police&mdash;by the help of which the International
Government could guarantee the condition
of permanent peace in the world.</p>

<p>II. You believe no doubt, because nearly everyone
believes it, that the conception of a League of
Nations is something quite new. Yet this is not
the case, although there is something new in the
present conception, something which did not exist
previously. The conception of a League of Nations
is very old, is indeed as old as modern International
Law, namely about four hundred years. International
Law could not have come into existence
without at the same time calling into existence a
League of Nations. <i>Any kind of an International
Law and some kind or other of a League of Nations
are interdependent and correlative.</i> This assertion
possibly surprises you, and I must therefore say a
few words concerning the origin of modern International
Law in order to make matters clear.</p>

<p>III. In ancient times no International Law in
the modern sense of the term existed. It is true
there existed rules of religion and of law concerning
international relations, and ambassadors and heralds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
were everywhere considered sacrosanct. But these
rules were not rules of an <i>International</i> Law, they
were either religious rules or rules which were part
of the Municipal Law of the several States. For
instance: the Romans had very detailed rules
concerning their relations with other States in time
of peace and war; but these were rules of Roman
law, not rules of the law of other countries, and
certainly not <i>international</i> rules.</p>

<p>Now what was the reason that antiquity did not
know of any International Law?</p>

<p>The reason was that between the several independent
States of antiquity no such intimate intercourse
arose and no such common views existed as
to necessitate a law between them. Only between
the several city States of ancient Greece arose some
kind of what we should now call 'International
Law,' because these city States formed a Community
fostered by the same language, the same civilisation,
the same religion, the same general ideas, and by
constant commercial and other intercourse. On
the other hand, the Roman Empire was a world
empire, it gradually absorbed all the independent
nations in the West. And when the Roman Empire
fell to pieces in consequence of the migration of the
peoples, the old civilisation came to an end, international
commerce and intercourse ceased almost
entirely, and it was not till towards the end of the
Middle Ages that matters began to change.</p>

<p>IV. During the second part of the Middle Ages
more and more independent States arose on the
European continent, and during the fifteenth and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
sixteenth centuries the necessity for a Law of Nations
made itself felt. A multitude of Sovereign States
had now established themselves which, although
they were absolutely independent of one another,
were knitted together by constant commercial and
other intercourse, by a common religion, and by
the same moral principles. Gradually and almost
unconsciously the conviction had grown upon these
independent States that, in spite of everything
which separated them, they formed a Community
the intercourse of which was ruled by certain legal
principles. International Law grew out of custom
because it was a necessity according to the well-known
rule <i>ubi societas ibi jus</i>, where there is a
community of interests there must be law. The
several independent States had thus gradually and
unconsciously formed themselves into a Society,
the afterwards so-called Family of Nations, or, in
other words, a League of Nations.</p>

<p>And no sooner had this League of Nations come
into existence&mdash;and even some time before that
date&mdash;than a number of schemes for the establishment
of eternal peace made their appearance.</p>

<p>The first of these schemes was that of the French
lawyer <i>Pierre Dubois</i>, who, as early as 1305, in his
work 'De recuperatione terre sancte,' proposed an
alliance between all Christian Powers for the purpose
of the maintenance of peace and the establishment
of a permanent Court of Arbitration for the settlement
of differences between members of the alliance.</p>

<p>Another was that of <i>Antoine Marini</i>, the Chancellor
of Podiebrad, King of Bohemia, who adopted the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
scheme in 1461. This scheme proposed the foundation
of a Federal State to comprise all the existing
Christian States and the establishment of a permanent
Congress to be seated at Basle in Switzerland, this
Congress to be the highest organ of the Federation.</p>

<p>A third scheme was that of <i>Sully</i>, adopted by
Henri IV of France, which, in 1603, proposed the
division of Europe into fifteen States and the linking
together of these into a Federation with a General
Council as its highest organ.</p>

<p>And a fourth scheme was that of <i>Emeric Cruc&eacute;e</i>,
who, in 1623, proposed the establishment of a Union
consisting not only of the Christian States but of
all States of the world, with a General Council seated
at Venice.</p>

<p>And since that time many other schemes of similar
kind have made their appearance, the enumeration
and discussion of which is outside our present purpose.
So much is certain that all these schemes
were Utopian. Nevertheless, a League of Nations
having once come into existence, International Law
grew more and more, and when in 1625 Hugo Grotius
published his immortal work on 'The Law of War
and Peace,' the system of International Law offered
in his work conquered the world and became the
basis of all following development.</p>

<p>V. However, although a League of Nations must
be said to have been in existence for about 400
years, because no International Law would have
been possible without it, this League of Nations
could not, and was not intended to, prevent war
between its members. I say: it could not prevent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
war. Why not? It could not prevent war on
account of the conditions which prevailed within
the international society from the Middle Ages till,
say, the outbreak of the present war. These conditions
are intimately connected with the growth
of the several States of Europe.</p>

<p>Whereas the family, the tribe, and the race are
natural products, the nation as well as the State are
products of historical development. All nations are
blends of more or less different races, and all States
were originally founded on force: strong rulers
subjected neighbouring tribes and peoples to their
sway and thus formed coherent nations. Most
of the States in Europe are the product of the
activity of strong dynasties which through war
and conquest, and through marriage and purchase,
united under one sovereign the lands which form
the States and the peoples which form the nations.
Up to the time of the French Revolution, throughout
the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
centuries, all wars were either wars of religion, or
dynastic wars fought for the increase of the territory
under the sway of the dynasties concerned, or so-called
colonial wars fought for the acquisition of
transoceanic colonies. It was not till the nineteenth
century that wars for the purpose of national
unity broke out, and dynastic wars began gradually
to disappear. During the nineteenth century the
nations, so to say, found themselves; some kind of
constitutional government was everywhere introduced;
and democracy became the ideal, although
it was by no means everywhere realised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>VI. It is for this reason that the outbreak of the
present war is epoch-making, because it has become
apparent that, whatever may be the war aims of
the belligerents, at bottom this World War is a
fight between the ideal of democracy and constitutional
government on the one hand, and autocratic
government and militarism on the other.
Everywhere the conviction has become prevalent
that things cannot remain as they were before the
outbreak of the present war, and therefore the
demand for a League of Nations, or&mdash;I had better
say&mdash;for a new League of Nations to take the place
of that which has been in existence for about 400
years, has arisen.</p>

<p>Now what is new in the desired new League of
Nations?</p>

<p>Firstly, this new League would be founded upon
a solemn treaty, whereas the League of Nations
hitherto was only based upon custom.</p>

<p>Secondly, for the purpose of making war rarer
or of abolishing it altogether, this new League
of Nations would enact the rule that no State is
allowed to resort to arms without previously having
submitted the dispute to an International Court or
a Council of Conciliation.</p>

<p>Thirdly, this new League of Nations would be
compelled to create some kind of organisation for
itself, because otherwise it could not realise its
purpose to make war rarer or abolish it altogether.</p>

<p>VII. The demand for a new League of Nations
is universal, for it is made, not only everywhere
in the allied countries, but in the countries of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Central Powers, and it will surely be realised when
the war is over, at any rate to a certain extent. It
is for this reason that the present World War has
not only not destroyed so-called Internationalism,
but has done more for it than many years of peace
could have done.</p>

<p>What is Internationalism?</p>

<p>Internationalism is the conviction that all the
civilised States form one Community throughout
the world in spite of the various factors which
separate the nations from one another; the conviction
that the interests of all the nations and States
are indissolubly interknitted, and that, therefore,
the Family of Nations must establish international
institutions for the purpose of guaranteeing a more
general and a more lasting peace than existed in
former times. Internationalism had made great
strides during the second part of the nineteenth
century on account of the enormous development
of international commerce and international communication
favoured by railways, the steamship,
the telegraph, and a great many scientific discoveries
and technical inventions. But what a disturbing
and destroying factor war really is, had not become
fully apparent till the present war, because this is a
<i>world</i> war which interferes almost as much with the
welfare of neutrals as with the welfare of belligerents.
It has become apparent during the present war that
the discoveries and developments of science and
technology, which had done so much during the
second half of the nineteenth century for the material
welfare of the human race during peace, were likewise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
at the disposal of belligerents for an enormous,
and hitherto unthought-of, destruction of life and
wealth. It is for this reason that in the camp of
friend and foe, among neutrals as well as among
belligerents, the conviction has become universal
that the conditions of international life prevailing
before the outbreak of the World War must be
altered; that international institutions must be
established which will make the outbreak of war,
if not impossible, at any rate only an exceptional
possibility. The demand for a new League of
Nations has thus arisen and peremptorily requires
fulfilment.</p>

<p>VIII. However, in considering the demand for
a new League of Nations, it is necessary to avoid
confusing nations with States. It should always
be remembered that, when we speak of a League of
Nations, we do not really mean a League of Nations
but a League of States. It is true that there are
many States in existence which in the main are
made up of one nation, although fractions of other
nations may be comprised in them. But it is equally
true that there are some States in existence which
include members of several nations. Take as an
example Switzerland which, although only a very
small State, nevertheless comprises three national
elements, namely German, French, and Italian.
Another example is the British Empire, which is a
world empire and comprises a number of different
nations.</p>

<p>That leads me to the question: What is a nation?</p>

<p>A nation must not be confounded with a race.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
A nation is a product of historical development,
whereas a race is a product of natural growth. One
speaks of a nation when a complex body of human
beings is united by living in the same land, by
the same language, the same literature, the same
historical traditions, and the same general views of
life. All nations are a mixture of several diverse
racial elements which in the course of historical
development have to a certain extent been united
by force of circumstances. The Swiss as a people
are politically a nation, although the component
parts of the population of Switzerland are of different
national characters and even speak different
languages. Historical development in general, and
in many cases force in particular, have played a
great part in the blending of diverse racial elements
into nations; just as they have played a great part
in the building up of States. The demand that
every nation should have a separate State of its
own&mdash;the ideal of the so-called national State&mdash;appears
very late in history; it is a product of the
last two centuries, and it was not till the second half
of the nineteenth century that the so-called principle
of nationality made its appearance and gained great
influence. It may well be doubted whether each
nation, be it ever so small, will succeed in establishing
a separate State of its own, although where
national consciousness becomes overwhelmingly
strong, it will probably in every case succeed in
time either in establishing a State of its own, or at
any rate in gaining autonomy. Be that as it may,
it is a question for the future; so much is certain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
what is intended now to be realised, is not a League
of Nations, but a League of States, although it is
called a League of Nations.</p>

<p>IX. However, no League of Nations is possible
unless the Central Powers, and Germany in especial,
are utterly defeated during the World War, and
that for two reasons.</p>

<p>One reason is that a great alteration of the map
of Europe is an absolutely necessary condition for
the satisfactory working of a League of Nations.
Unless an independent Poland be established; unless
the problem of Alsace-Lorraine be solved; unless
the Trentino be handed over to Italy; unless the
Yugo-Slavs be united with Servia; unless the
Czecho-Slovaks be freed from the Austrian yoke;
and unless the problem of Turkey and the Turkish
Straits be solved, no lasting peace can be expected
in Europe, even if a League of Nations be established.</p>

<p>The other reason is that, unless Germany be
utterly defeated, the spirit of militarism, which is
not compatible with a League of Nations, will remain
a menace to the world.</p>

<p>What is militarism? It is that conception of the
State which bases the power of the State, its influence,
its progress, and its development exclusively on
military force. The consequence is that war becomes
part of the settled policy of a militarist State; the
acquisition of further territory and population by
conquest is continually before the eyes of such a
Government; and the condition of peace is only a
shorter or longer interval between periods of war.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
A military State submits to International Law only
so long as it serves its interests, but violates International
Law, and particularly International Law
concerning war, wherever and whenever this law
stands in the way of its military aims. The whole
history of Prussia exemplifies this. Now in a League
of Nations peace must be the normal condition.
If war occurs at all within such a League, it can
only be an exceptional phase and must be only for
the purpose of re-establishing peace. It is true a
League of Nations will not be able entirely to dispense
with military force, yet such force appears
only in the background as an <i>ultima ratio</i> to be applied
against such Power as refuses to submit its
disagreements with other members of the League
either to an International Court of Justice or an
International Council of Conciliation.</p>

<p>X. Be that as it may, in a sense the League of
Nations has already started its career, because
twenty-five States are united on the one side and
are fighting this war in vindication of International
Law. These States are&mdash;I enumerate them chronologically
as they entered into the war:&mdash;Russia
(the Bolsheviks have made peace, but in fact one
may still enumerate Russia as a belligerent), France,
Belgium, Great Britain, Servia, Montenegro, Japan,
San Marino, Portugal, Italy, Roumania, the United
States, Cuba, Panama, Greece, Siam, Liberia, China,
Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica,
Haiti, Honduras. Besides these twenty-five States
which are at war with the Central Powers, the following
four States, without having declared war, have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
broken off diplomatic relations with Germany,
namely: Bolivia, San Domingo, Peru, Uruguay.</p>

<p>Now there may be said to be about fifty civilised
States in existence. Of these, as I have just pointed
out, twenty-five are fighting against the Central
Powers, four have broken off relations with Germany,
the Central Powers themselves are four in number,
with the consequence that thirty-three of the fifty
States are implicated in the war. Only the seventeen
remaining States are neutral, namely: Sweden,
Norway, Denmark, Holland, Luxemburg, Switzerland,
Spain, Lichtenstein, and Monaco in Europe;
Mexico, Salvador, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile,
Argentina, and Paraguay in America; and Persia
in Asia.</p>

<p>It may be taken for granted that all the neutral
States, and all the States fighting on the side of
the Allies, and also the four States which, although
they are not fighting on the side of the Allies, have
broken off relations with Germany, are prepared
to enter into a League of Nations.</p>

<p>But what about the Central Powers, and Germany
in especial? I shall discuss in my next lecture the
question whether the Central Powers are to become
members of the League. To-day it must suffice to
say that, when once utterly defeated, they will be
only too glad to be received as members. On the
other hand, if they were excluded, the world would
again be divided into two rival camps, just as before
the war the Triple Alliance was faced by the Entente.
No disarmament would be possible, and with regard
to every other matter progress would be equally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
impossible. Therefore the Central Powers must
become members of a League of Nations for such
a League to be of any great use, which postulates
as a <i>sine qua non</i> that Germany must be utterly
defeated in the present war. If she were victorious,
or if peace were concluded with an undefeated
Germany, the world would not be ripe for a League
of Nations because militarism would not have been
exterminated.</p>

<p>XI. I have hitherto discussed the League of
Nations only in a general way, without mentioning
that there is no unanimity concerning its aims or
concerning the details of its organisation. Many
people think that it would be possible to do away
with war for ever, and they therefore demand a
World State, a Federal State comprising all the
single States of the world on the pattern of the
United States of America. And for this reason the
demand is raised not only for an International Court
and for an International Council of Conciliation,
but also for an International Government, an International
Parliament, and an International Army
and Navy,&mdash;a so-called International Police.</p>

<p>I believe that these demands go much too far
and are impossible of realisation. A Federal State
comprising all the single States of the whole civilised
world is a Utopia, and an International Army and
Navy would be a danger to the peace of the world.</p>

<p>Why is a World State not possible, at any rate
not in our time?</p>

<p>No one has ever thought that a World State in
the form of one single State with one single Government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
would be possible. Those who plead for a
World State plead for it in the form of a Federal
State comprising all the single States of the world
on the pattern of the United States of America.
But even this modified ideal is not, in my opinion,
realisable at present. Why not? To realise this
ideal there would be required a Federal Government,
and a Federal Parliament; and the Federal Government
would have to possess strong powers to enforce
its demands. A powerless Federal Government
would be worse than no government at all. But
how is it possible to establish at present a powerful
Federal Government over the whole world? How is
it possible to establish a Federal World Parliament?</p>

<p>Constitutional Government within the several
States has to grapple with many difficulties, and
these difficulties would be more numerous, greater,
and much more complicated within a Federal World
State. We need democracy and constitutional
Government in every single State, and this can only
be realised by party Government and elections of
Parliament at short intervals. The waves of party
strife rise high within the several States; no sooner
is one party in, than the other party looks out for
an opening into which a wedge can be pushed to
turn the Government out. In normal times this
works on the whole quite well within the borders
of the several States, because the interests concerned
are not so widely opposed to one another
that the several parties cannot alternatively govern.
But when it comes to applying the same system of
Government to a Federal World State, the interests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
at stake are too divergent. The East and the West,
the South and the North, the interests of maritime
States and land-locked States, the ideals and interests
of industrial and agricultural States, and many other
contrasts, are too great for it to be possible to govern
a Federal World State by the same institutions as a
State of ordinary size and composition.</p>

<p>The British World Empire may be taken as an
example to show that it is impossible for one single
central Government to govern a number of States
with somewhat divergent interests. We all know
that the British Empire comprising the United
Kingdom and the so-called independent dominions,
namely Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New
Zealand, and South Africa, is kept together not
really by the powers of the British Government
but by the good will of the component parts. The
Government of the United Kingdom could not
keep the Empire together by force, could not compel
by force one of the independent dominions to submit
to a demand, in case it refused to comply. The
interests of the several component parts of the
British Empire are so divergent that no central
Government could keep them together against their
will. Now what applies to the British Empire, which
is to a great extent bound together by the same
language, the same literature, and the same Law,
would apply much more to a Federal State comprising
the whole of the world: such a Federal State, so
far as we can see, is impossible.</p>

<p>XII. But what about an International Army and
Navy?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>It is hardly worth while to say much about them.
Those who propose the establishment of an International
Army and Navy presuppose that the
national armies and navies would be abolished so
that the world Government would have the power,
with the help of the International Army and Navy,
at any moment to crush any attempt of a recalcitrant
member of the Federal World State to avoid its
duties. This International Army and Navy would
be the most powerful instrument of force which the
world has ever seen, because every attempt to resist
it would be futile. And the Commander of the
International Army and the Commander of the
International Navy would be men holding in their
hands the greatest power that can be imagined.</p>

<p>The old question therefore arises: <i>Quis custodiet
ipsos custodes?</i> which I should like here to translate
freely by: Who will keep in order those who are
to keep the world in order? A League of Nations
which can only be kept together by a powerful
International Army and Navy, is a contradiction
in itself; for the independence and equality of the
member States of the League would soon disappear.
It is a fact&mdash;I make this statement although I am
sure it will be violently contradicted&mdash;that, just as
hitherto, so within a League of Nations some kind
of Balance of Power only can guarantee the independence
and equality of the smaller States. For
the Community of Power, on which the League of
Nations must rest, would at once disappear if one
or two members of the League became so powerful
that they could disregard the combined power of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the other members. Every scheme of this movement
must therefore see to it that no member of the
League is more armed than is necessary considering
the extent of its territory and other factors concerned.
But be that as it may, an International Army and
Navy is practically impossible, just as a Federal
World State is impossible.</p>

<p>XIII. Yet while a Federal World State is impossible,
a League of Nations is not, provided such league
gives itself a constitution, not of a state-like character,
but one <i>sui generis</i>. What can be done is this: the
hitherto unorganised Family of Nations can organise
itself on simple lines so as to secure, on the one
hand, the absolute independence of every State,
and, on the other hand, the peaceful co-existence
of all the States.</p>

<p>It is possible, in my opinion, to establish an International
Court of Justice before which the several
States engage to appear in case a conflict arises
between two or more of them which can be judicially
settled, that is, can be settled by a rule of law. There
is as little reason why two or more States should
go to war on account of a conflict which can be
settled upon the basis of law, as there is for two
private individuals to resort to arms in case of a
dispute between them which can be decided by a
Court of Law.</p>

<p>Again, although there will frequently arise between
States conflicts of a political character which cannot
be settled on the basis of a rule of law, there is no
reason why, when the States in conflict cannot settle
them by diplomatic negotiation, they should resort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to arms, before bringing the conflict before some
Council of Conciliation and giving the latter an
opportunity of investigating the matter and proposing
a fair compromise.</p>

<p>Under modern conditions of civilisation the whole
world suffers in case war breaks out between even
only two States, and for this reason it is advisable
that the rest of the world should unite and oppose
such State as would resort to arms without having
submitted its case to an International Court of
Justice or an International Council of Conciliation.</p>

<p>XIV. In my opinion the aims of a League of
Nations should therefore be three:</p>

<p>The first aim should be to prevent the outbreak
of war altogether on account of so-called judicial
disputes, that is disputes which can be settled on
the basis of a rule of law. For this reason the League
should stipulate that every State must submit all
judicial disputes without exception to an International
Court of Justice and must abide by the
judgment of such Court.</p>

<p>The second aim should be to prevent the sudden
outbreak of war on account of a political dispute and
to insist on an opportunity for mediation. For this
reason the League should stipulate that every State,
previous to resorting to arms over a political dispute,
must submit it to an International Council of Conciliation
and must at any rate listen to the advice
of such Council.</p>

<p>The third aim should be to provide a sanction
for the enforcement of the two rules just mentioned.
For this reason the League should stipulate that all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the member States of the League must unite their
economic, military, and naval forces against such
member or members as would resort to arms either
on account of a judicial dispute which ought to have
been settled by an International Court of Justice,
or on account of a political dispute without previously
having submitted it to an International Council of
Conciliation and listened to the latter's advice.</p>

<p>These should be, in my opinion, the three aims of
a League of Nations and the three rules necessary
for the realisation of these aims. However, it is not
so easy to realise them, and it is therefore necessary
to face and solve four problems: There is, firstly,
the problem of the Organisation of the League;
secondly, the problem of Legislation within the
League; thirdly, the problem of Administration of
Justice within the League; and fourthly, the problem
of Mediation within the League&mdash;four problems which
I shall discuss in the two following lectures.</p>

<p>I have only named three aims and four problems
because I have in my mind those aims which are the
nearest and those problems which are the most
pressing and the most urgent. The range of vision
of the League of Nations, when once established,
will no doubt gradually become wider and wider;
new aims will arise and new problems will demand
solution, but all such possible future aims and future
problems are outside the scope of these lectures.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Second Lecture</span><br />
ORGANISATION AND LEGISLATION OF
THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS</h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>

<div class="fss"><p>I. The Community of civilised States, the at present existing
League of Nations, is a community without any organisation, although
there are plenty of legal rules for the intercourse of the several
States one with another.</p>

<p>II. The position of the Great Powers within the Community of
States is a mere political fact not based on Law.</p>

<p>III. The pacifistic demand for a Federal World State in order
to make the abolition of war a possibility.</p>

<p>IV. Every attempt at organising the desired new League of
Nations must start from, and keep intact, the independence and
equality of the several States, with the consequence that the establishment
of a central political authority above the sovereign States
is an impossibility.</p>

<p>V. The development of an organisation of the Community of
States began before the outbreak of the World War and is to be
found in the establishment of the Permanent Court of Arbitration
at the Hague by the First Hague Peace Conference of 1899. But
more steps will be necessary to turn the hitherto unorganised Community
of States into an organised League of Nations.</p>

<p>VI. The organisation of the desired new League of Nations should
start from the beginning made by the Hague Peace Conferences, and
the League should therefore include all the independent civilised States.</p>

<p>VII. The objection to the reception of the Central Powers, and
of Germany especially, into the League.</p>

<p>VIII. The objection to the reception of the minor transoceanic
States into the League.</p>

<p>IX. The seven principles which ought to be accepted with regard
to the organisation of the new League of Nations.</p>

<p>X. The organisation of the League of Nations is not an end in
itself but only a means of attaining three objects, the first of which
is International Legislation. The meaning of the term 'International
Legislation' in contradistinction to Municipal Legislation.
International Legislation in the past and in the future.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>XI. The difficulty in the way of International Legislation on

<h3>THE LECTURE</h3>

<p>I. In my first lecture on the League of Nations
I recommended the following three rules to be laid
down by a League of Nations:</p>

<p>Firstly, every State must submit all judicial
disputes to an International Court of Justice and
must abide by the judgment of such Court.</p>

<p>Secondly, every State previous to resorting to
arms, must submit every political and non-judicial
dispute to an International Council of Conciliation
and must at any rate listen to the advice of such
Council.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the member States must unite their
forces against such State or States as should resort
to arms without previously having submitted the
matter in dispute to an International Court of
Justice or to an International Council of Conciliation.</p>

<p>And I added that these three rules cannot create
a satisfactory condition of affairs unless four problems
are faced and solved, namely: The Organisation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the League, Legislation by the League, Administration
of Justice and Mediation within the League. My lecture
to-day will deal with two of these problems, namely
the Organisation and the Legislation of the League.</p>

<p>Let us first consider the Organisation of the
League. Hitherto the body of civilised States
which form the Family of Nations and which, as
I pointed out in my first lecture, is really a League
of Nations evolved by custom, has been an unorganised
Community. This means that, although
there are plenty of legal rules for the intercourse
of the several States one with another, the Community
of civilised States does not possess any
permanently established organs or agents for the
conduct of its common affairs. At present these
affairs, if they are peaceably settled, are either
settled by ordinary diplomatic negotiation or, if
the matter is pressing and of the greatest importance,
by temporarily convened International Conferences
or Congresses.</p>

<p>II. It is true there are the so-called Great Powers
which are the leaders of the Family of Nations, and
it is therefore asserted by some authorities that the
Community of States has acquired a certain amount
of organisation because the Great Powers are the
legally recognised superiors of the minor States.</p>

<p>But is this assertion correct? The Great Powers,
are they really the legally recognised superiors of
the minor States?</p>

<p>I deny it. A Great Power is any large-sized
State possessing a large population which gains
such economic, military, and naval strength that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
its political influence must be reckoned with by
all the other Powers. At the time of the outbreak
of the World War eight States had to be considered
as Great Powers, namely Great Britain, Austria-Hungary,
France, Germany, Italy, Russia, the
United States of America, and Japan. But it is
very probable that the end of the World War will
see the number of Great Powers reduced to six.
The collapse and break up of Russia has surely for
the present eliminated her from the number of Great
Powers. And it is quite certain that Austria-Hungary
will not emerge from the struggle as a
Great Power, if she emerges from it as a whole at
all. History teaches that the number of the Great
Powers is by no means stable, and changes occasionally
take place. Look at the condition of affairs
during the nineteenth century. Whereas at the
time of the Vienna Congress in 1815 eight States,
namely Great Britain, Austria, France, Portugal,
Prussia, Spain, Sweden, and Russia were still considered
Great Powers, their number soon decreased
to five, because Portugal, Spain, and Sweden ceased
to be Great Powers. On the other hand, Italy
joined the number of the Great Powers after her
unification in 1860; the United States of America
joined the Great Powers after the American Civil
War in 1865; and Japan emerged as a Great Power
from her war with China in 1895.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, so much is certain, a State
is a Great Power not by law but only by its political
influence. The Great Powers are the leaders of the
Family of Nations because their political influence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
is so great. Their political and economic influence
is in the long run irresistible; therefore all arrangements
made by the Great Powers naturally in most
cases gain, either at once or in time, the consent
of the minor States. It may be said that the
Great Powers exercise a kind of political hegemony
within the Family of Nations. Yet this hegemony
is not based on law, it is simply a political fact, and
it is certainly not a consequence of an organisation
of the Family of Nations.</p>

<p>III. The demand for a proper organisation of
the Community of States had, up to the outbreak
of the World War, been raised exclusively on the
part of the so-called Pacifists in order to make the
abolition of war a possibility. It is a common
assertion on the part of the Pacifists that War cannot
die out so long as there is no Central Political
Authority in existence above the several States
which could compel them to bring their disputes
before an International Court and also compel them
to carry out the judgments of such a Court. For
this reason many Pacifists aim at such an organisation
of the Community of States as would bring all
the civilised States of the world within the bonds
of a federation. They demand a World Federation
of all the civilised States, or at any rate a federation
of the States of Europe, on the model of the
United States of America.</p>

<p>If such a Federal World State were practically
possible, there would be no objection to it, although
International Law as such would cease to exist and
be replaced by the Constitutional Law of this Federal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
World State. But in my first lecture I pointed
out that such a Federal World State is practically
impossible. And it is not even desirable.</p>

<p>The development of mankind would seem in
the main to be indissolubly connected with the
national development of the peoples. Most peoples
possessing a strong national consciousness desire an
independent State in which they can live according
to their own ideals. They want to be their own
masters, and not to be part and parcel of a Federal
World State to which they would have to surrender
a great part of their independence. Moreover&mdash;as I
likewise pointed out in my first lecture (pp. <a href="#Page_18">18-20</a>)&mdash;it
would be impossible to establish a strong
Government and a strong Parliament in a Federal
World State.</p>

<p>However this may be, it is not at all certain that
war would altogether disappear in a Federal World
State. The history of Federal States teaches that
wars do occasionally break out between their member
States. Think of the war between the Roman
Catholic and the Protestant member States of the
Swiss Confederation in 1847, of the war in 1863
between the Northern and the Southern member
States within the Federation which is called the
United States of America, and of the war between
Prussia and Austria within the German Confederation
in 1866.</p>

<p>IV. But what kind of organisation of the League
of Nations is possible if we reject the idea of a Federal
State?</p>

<p>Neither I, nor anyone else who does not like to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
build castles in the air, can answer this question
directly by making a detailed proposal. It is at
present quite impossible to work out a practical
scheme according to which a more detailed organisation
of the League of Nations could be realised.
But so much is certain that every attempt at
organising this League must start from, and must
keep intact, the independence and the equality of
all civilised States. It is for this reason that a
Central Political Authority above the sovereign
States can never be thought of. Every attempt
to organise a League of Nations on the model of a
Federal State is futile. If a detailed organisation
of the League should ever come, it will be one <i>sui
generis</i>, one absolutely of its own kind; such as
has never been seen before. And it is at present
quite impossible to map out a detailed plan of such
an organisation although, as I shall have to show
you later, the first step towards an organisation
has already been made, and further steps towards
the ideal can be taken. The reason that it is at
present impossible is that the growth and the final
shape of the organisation of the League of Nations
will, and must, go hand in hand with the progress
of International Law. But the progress of International
Law is conditioned by the growth, the
strengthening, and the deepening of international
economic and other interests, and of international
morality. It is a matter of course that this progress
can only be realised very slowly, for there is concerned
a process of development through many
generations and perhaps through centuries, a development<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
whose end no one can foresee. It is sufficient
for us to state that the development had already
begun before the World War, and to try to foster
it, as far as is in our power, after the conclusion
of peace.</p>

<p>V. I said that this development has begun.
Where is this beginning of the development to be
found?</p>

<p>It is to be found in the establishment of the Permanent
Court of Arbitration at the Hague and the
Office therewith connected. The Permanent Court
of Arbitration is not an institution of the several
States, but an institution of the Community of
States in contradistinction to its several members.
Had the International Prize Court agreed upon by
the Second Hague Peace Conference of 1907 been
established, there would have come into existence
another institution of the Community of States.</p>

<p>But the establishment of International Courts
would not justify the assertion that thereby the
Community of States has turned from an unorganised
community into an organised community. To
reach this goal another step is required, namely an
agreement amongst the Powers, according to which
the Hague Peace Conferences would be made a
permanent institution which periodically, within
fixed intervals, assemble without being convened
by one Power or another. If this were done, we
could say that the hitherto unorganised Community
of States had turned into an organised League of
Nations, for by such periodically assembling Hague
Peace Conferences there would be established an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
organ for the conduct of all such international
matters as require international legislation or other
international action.</p>

<p>However that may be, the organisation created
by the fact that the Hague Peace Conferences
periodically assembled, would only be an immature
one; more steps would be necessary in order that
the organisation of the Community of States might
become more perfect and more efficient. Yet progress
would be slow, for every attempt at a progressive
step meets with opposition, and it would be only
when the <i>international</i> interests of the civilised States
become victorious over their particular <i>national</i>
interests that the Community of States would
gradually receive a more perfect organisation.</p>

<p>VI. There is no doubt that the experiences of
mankind during the World War have been quickening
development more than could have been
expected in normal times. The universal demand
for a new League of Nations accepting the principles
that every judicial dispute amongst nations must
be settled by International Courts and that every
political dispute must, before the parties resort to
arms, be brought before a Council of Conciliation,
demonstrates clearly that the Community of States
must now deliberately give itself some kind of
organisation, because without it the principles just
mentioned cannot be realised.</p>

<p>Now a number of schemes for the organisation of
a new League of Nations have been made public.
They all agree upon the three aims of the League
and the three rules for the realisation of these aims<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
which I mentioned in my first lecture, namely compulsory
settlement of all judicial disputes by International
Courts of Justice, compulsory mediation
in cases of political disputes by an International
Council of Conciliation, and the duty of the members
of the League to turn against any one member
which should resort to arms in violation of the
principles laid down by the League. However,
these schemes differ very much with regard to the
<i>organisation</i> of the League. I cannot now discuss
the various schemes in detail. It must suffice to
say that some of them embody proposals for a more
or less state-like organisation and are therefore not
acceptable to those who share my opinion that any
state-like organisation of the League is practically
impossible. But though some of the schemes, as
for instance that of Lord Bryce and that of Sir
Willoughby Dickinson, avoid this mistake, none of
them take as their starting point that which I
consider to be the right one, namely the beginning
made at the two Hague Peace Conferences. <i>In my
opinion the organisation of a new League of Nations
should start from the beginning made by the two Hague
Peace Conferences.</i></p>

<p>VII. However, there is much objection to this,
because it would necessitate the admission into
the new League of all those States which took part
in the Second Hague Peace Conference, including,
of course, the Central Powers. The objections to
such a wide range of the League are two-fold.</p>

<p>In the first instance, the admission of the Central
Powers, and especially of Germany, into the League<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
is deprecated. By her attack on Belgium at the
outbreak of the war, and by her general conduct
of the war, Germany has deliberately taken up an
attitude which proves that, when her military
interests are concerned, she does not consider herself
bound by any treaty, by any rule of law, or by
any principle of humanity. How can we expect
that she will carry out the engagements into which
she might enter by becoming a member of the League
of Nations?</p>

<p>My answer is that, provided she be utterly defeated
and no peace of compromise be made with her,
militarism in Germany will be doomed, the reparation
to be exacted from her for the many cruel wrongs
must lead to a change of Constitution and Government,
and this change of Constitution and Government
will make Germany a more acceptable member
of a new League of Nations. The utter defeat of
Germany is a necessary preliminary condition to
the possibility of her entrance into a League of
Nations. Those who speak of the foundation of a
League of Nations as a means of ending the World
War by a peace of compromise with Germany are
mistaken. The necessary presuppositions of such a
League are entirely incompatible with an unbroken
Prussian militarism.</p>

<p>But while her utter defeat is the necessary preliminary
condition to her entrance into a League of
Nations, the inclusion of Germany in the League,
after her utter defeat, is likewise a necessity. The
reason is that, as I pointed out in my first lecture
(p. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>), in case the Central Powers were excluded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
from the League, they would enter into a League
of their own, and the world would then be divided
into two rival camps, in the same way as before the
war the Triple Alliance was faced by the Entente.
<i>The world would be proved not ripe for a new League
of Nations if peace were concluded with an undefeated
Germany; and the League would miss its purpose if
to a defeated and repenting Germany entrance into it
were refused.</i></p>

<p>VIII. In the second instance, the entrance of the
great number of minor transoceanic States into
the League is deprecated because these States would
claim an equal vote with the European Powers and
thereby obstruct progress within the League.</p>

<p>It is asserted that some of the minor transatlantic
States made the discussions at the Hague Conferences
futile by their claim to an equal vote. Now
it is true that some of these States have to a certain
extent impeded the work of the Hague Conferences,
but some of the minor States of Europe, and even
some of the Great Powers, have done likewise.
The Community of States consisting of sovereign
States does not possess any means of compelling a
minority of States to fall in with the views of the
majority, but I shall show you very soon, when I
approach the problem of International Legislation,
that International Legislation of a kind is possible
in spite of this fact. And so much is certain that
the minimum of organisation of the new League
which is now necessary, cannot be considered to
be endangered by the admittance of the minor
transoceanic States into the League. Progress will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in any case be slow, and perfect unanimity among
the Powers will in any and every case only be possible
where the <i>international</i> interests of all the Powers
compel them to put aside their real or imaginary
particular <i>national</i> interests.</p>

<p>IX. For these reasons I take it for granted that
the organisation of a new League of Nations should
start from the beginning made by the Hague Peace
Conferences. Therefore the following seven principles
ought to be accepted:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>First principle: The League of Nations is
composed of all civilised States which recognise
one another's external and internal independence
and absolute equality before International Law.</p>

<p>Second principle: The chief organ of the
League is the Peace Conference at the Hague.
The Peace Conferences meet periodically&mdash;say
every two or three years&mdash;without being convened
by any special Power. Their task is the
gradual codification of International Law and
the agreement upon such International Conventions
as are from time to time necessitated
by new circumstances and conditions.</p>

<p>Third principle: A permanent Council of
the Conference is to be created, the members
of which are to be resident at the Hague and
are to conduct all the current business of the
League of Nations. This current business
comprises: The preparation of the meetings
of the Peace Conference; the conduct of communications
with the several members of the
League with regard to the preparation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
work of the Peace Conferences; and all other
matters of international interest which the
Conference from time to time hands over to
the Council.</p>

<p>Fourth principle: Every recognised sovereign
State has a right to take part in the Peace
Conferences.</p>

<p>Fifth principle: Resolutions of the Conference
can come into force only in so far as they become
ratified by the several States concerned. On
the other hand, every State agrees once for all
faithfully to carry out those resolutions which
have been ratified by it.</p>

<p>Sixth principle: Every State that takes
part in the Peace Conferences is bound only
by such resolutions of the Conferences as it
expressly agrees to and ratifies. Resolutions of a
majority only bind the majority. On the other
hand, no State has a right to demand that
only such resolutions as it agrees to shall be
adopted.</p>

<p>Seventh principle: All members of the
League of Nations agree once for all to submit
all judicial disputes to International Courts
which are to be set up, and to abide by their
judgments. They likewise agree to submit,
previous to resorting to arms, all non-judicial
disputes to International Councils of Conciliation
which are to be set up. And they all
agree to unite their economic, military, and
naval forces against any one or more States
which resort to arms without submitting their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
disputes to International Courts of Justice or
International Councils of Conciliation.</p></div>

<p>You will have noticed that my proposals do not
comprise the creation of an International Government,
an International Executive, an International
Parliament, and an International Army and Navy
which would serve as an International Police Force.
No one can look into the future and say what it will
bring, but it is certain that for the present, and for
some generations to come, all attempts at creating
an International Government are not only futile
but dangerous; because it is almost certain that
a League of Nations comprising an International
Executive, an International Parliament, and an
International Army and Navy would soon collapse.</p>

<p>X. However this may be, and whatever may be
the details of the organisation of the League, such
necessary organisation is not an end in itself but a
means of attaining three objects, namely: International
Legislation, International Administration
of Justice, and International Mediation. I shall
discuss International Administration of Justice and
International Mediation in my next lecture, to-day
I will only draw your attention to International
Legislation.</p>

<p>In using the term 'International Legislation,'
it must be understood that 'legislation' is here
to be understood in a figurative sense only. When
we speak of legislation in everyday language, we
mean that process of parliamentary activity by
which Municipal Statutes are called into existence.
Municipal Legislation presupposes a sovereign power,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
which prescribes rules of conduct to its subjects.
It is obvious that within the Community of States
no such kind of legislation can take place. Rules of
conduct for the members of the League of Nations
can only be created by an agreement amongst those
members. Whereas Municipal Statutes contain the
rules of conduct set by an authority sovereign over
its subjects, International Statutes&mdash;if I may be
allowed to use that term&mdash;contain rules of conduct
which the members of the Community of States
have agreed to set for themselves. International
Statutes are created by the so-called Law-making
Treaties of the Powers. But in one point Municipal
Legislation and the Law-making Treaties of the
Powers resemble one another very closely:&mdash;both
intend to create law, and for this reason it is permissible
to use the term 'International Legislation'
figuratively for the conclusion of such international
treaties as contain rules of International Law.</p>

<p>Now it would be very misleading to believe that
no International Legislation has taken place in
the past. The fact is that, from the Vienna Congress
of 1815 onwards, agreements have been arrived at
upon a number of rules of International Law. However,
such agreements have only occurred occasionally,
because the Community of civilised States
has not hitherto possessed a permanently established
organ for legislating. Much of the legislation which
has taken place in the past was only a by-product
of Congresses or Conferences which had assembled
for other purposes. On the other hand, when legislation
on a certain subject was considered pressing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a Congress or Conference was convened for that
very purpose. It will be only when the Hague
Peace Conferences have become permanently established
that an organ of the League of Nations for
legislating internationally will be at hand. And
a wide field is open for such legislation. The bulk
of International Law in its present state is&mdash;if I
may say so&mdash;a book law, it is customary law which
is only to be found in text-books of International
Law; it is, as regards many points, controversial;
it has many gaps; and it is in many ways uncertain.
International Legislation will be able gradually
to create international statutes which will turn
this book law into firm, clear, and authoritative
statutory law.</p>

<p>XI. But you must not imagine that International
Legislation is an easy matter. It is in fact full of
difficulties of all kinds. I will only mention four:</p>

<p>There is, firstly, the language question. Since it
is impossible to draft International Statutes in all
languages, it is absolutely necessary to agree upon
one language, and this language at present is, as
you all know, French. Yet, difficult as the language
question is, it is not insurmountable. It is hardly
greater than the difficulty which arises when two
States, which speak different languages, have to
agree upon an ordinary convention. One point,
however, must be specially observed, and that is:
when any question of the interpretation of an International
Statute occurs, it is the French text of the
statute which is authoritative, and not the text of
the translation into other languages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>XII. Another difficulty with regard to International
Legislation is the conflicting <i>national</i> interests
of the different States. As International Statutes
are only possible when the several States come to
an agreement, it will often not be possible to legislate
internationally on a given matter, because the
interests of the different States will be so conflicting
that an agreement cannot be arrived at. On the
other hand, as time goes on the international interests
of the several States frequently become so powerful
that these Governments are quite ready to brush
aside their particular interests, and to agree upon a
compromise which makes International Legislation
concerning the matter in question possible.</p>

<p>XIII. A third difficulty with regard to International
Legislation is of quite a particular kind.
It arises from the fact that International Statutes
cannot be created by a vote of the majority of States,
but only by a unanimous vote of all the members
of the Community of civilised States.</p>

<p>This difficulty, however, can be overcome by
dropping the contention that no legislation of any
kind can be proceeded with unless every member
of the League of Nations agrees to it. It is a well-known
fact that a distinction has to be made between
<i>universal</i> International Law, that is, rules to which
every civilised State agrees, and <i>general</i> International
Law, that is, rules to which only the greater
number of States agree. Now it is quite certain
that no universal International Law can be created
by legislation to which not every member of the
League of Nations has agreed. Nothing, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
ought to prevent those States which are ready to
agree to certain new rules of International Law, from
legislating <i>for their own number</i> on a certain matter.
If such legislation is really of value, the time will
come when the dissenting States will gradually
accede. The Second Hague Peace Conference acted
on this principle, for a good many of its Conventions
were only agreed upon by the greater number, and
not by all, of the participating States.</p>

<p>XIV. A fourth difficulty with regard to International
Legislation is the difficulty of the interpretation
of, and the construction to be put upon, International
Statutes as well as ordinary international
conventions. We do not as yet possess universally
recognised rules of International Law concerning
such interpretation and construction. Each nation
applies to International Statutes those rules of
interpretation and construction which are valid for
the interpretation and construction of their Municipal
Statutes.</p>

<p>Many international disputes have been due in
the past to this difficulty of interpretation and construction.
A notorious example is that of the
interpretation of Article 23(h) of the Hague Regulations
of 1907 concerning Land Warfare, which lays
down the rule that it is forbidden 'to declare
abolished, suspended, or inadmissible in a Court of
Law the rights and actions of the nationals of the
hostile party.'</p>

<p>Germany and other continental States interpret
this article to mean that the Municipal Law of a
State is not allowed to declare that the outbreak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of war suspends or avoids contracts with alien
enemies, or that war prevents alien enemies from
bringing an action in the Courts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, England and the United
States of America interpret this article to mean
merely that the <i>occupant of enemy territory</i> is prohibited
from declaring abolished, suspended, or inadmissible
in a Court of Law the rights and actions
of the nationals of the hostile party.</p>

<p>What is the cause of this divergent interpretation
of an article, the literal meaning of which seems to
be quite clear? The divergence is due to the different
mode of interpretation of statutes resorted to by
continental Courts, on the one hand, and, on the
other hand, by British and American Courts.</p>

<p>Continental Courts take into consideration not
only the literal meaning of a clause of a statute,
but also the intention of the legislator as evidenced
by&mdash;what I should like to call&mdash;the history of the
clause. They look for the intention of the draftsman,
they search the Parliamentary proceedings concerning
the clause, and they interpret and construe the
clause with regard to the intention of the draftsman
as well as to the proceedings in Parliament.</p>

<p>Now Article 23(h) of the Hague Regulations was
inserted on the motion of the German delegates to
the Second Hague Peace Conference, and there is
no doubt that the German delegates intended by
its insertion to prevent the Municipal Law of belligerents
from possessing a rule according to which
the outbreak of war suspends or avoids contracts
with alien enemies, and prohibits alien enemies from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
bringing an action in the Courts. It is for this
reason that Germany and other continental States
interpret Article 23(h) according to the intention
of the German delegates.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in interpreting and construing
a clause of a statute, British and American Courts
refuse to take into consideration the intention of
the draftsman, Parliamentary discussions concerning
the clause, and the like. They only take into
consideration the literal meaning of the clause as it
stands in the statute of which it is a part. Now
Article 23(h) is a clause in the Convention concerning
the Laws and Customs of War on Land. It is one
of several paragraphs of Article 23 which comprises
the prohibition of a number of acts by the armed
forces of belligerents in warfare on land, such as
the employment of poison or poisoned arms, and
the like. The British and American delegates,
believing that it only concerned an act on the part
of belligerent forces occupying enemy territory,
therefore consented to the insertion of Article 23(h),
and our Court of Appeal&mdash;in the case of Porter <i>v.</i>
Freundenberg (1915)&mdash;held that Article 23(h) is to
be interpreted in that sense.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>Be that as it may, the difficulty of interpretation
and construction of international treaties will exist
so long as no International Statute has been agreed
upon which lays down detailed rules concerning
interpretation and construction, or so long as International
Courts have not developed such rules in
practice. But the problem of International Courts
is itself a very difficult one; it will be the subject
of my third lecture which will deal with Administration
of Justice and Mediation within the League
of Nations.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> By a letter of February 28, 1911, I drew the attention of the
Foreign Office to the interpretation of Article 23(h) which generally
prevailed on the Continent. This letter and the answer I received
were privately printed, and copies were distributed amongst those
members and associates of the Institute of International Law who
attended the meeting at Madrid. Since French, German, and
Italian International Law Journals published translations, but the
original of the correspondence was never published in this country,
I think it advisable to append it to this lecture.</p></div>

<h3>APPENDIX</h3>

<p class="center">CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE FOREIGN
OFFICE RESPECTING THE INTERPRETATION<br />
OF ARTICLE 23(h) OF THE
HAGUE REGULATIONS CONCERNING
LAND WARFARE</p>

<h4>LETTER FROM THE PRESENT WRITER TO THE
FOREIGN OFFICE.</h4>

<div class="bk2"><p class="p5"><span class="smcap">Whewell House, Cambridge</span>,</p>
<p class="td2"><i>28th February, 1911</i>.</p></div>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">To<br />
The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>I venture to bring the following matter before your
consideration:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the course of my recent studies I have been dealing with the
laws and usages of war on land, and I have had to consider the
interpretation of Article 23(h) of the Regulations attached to the
Convention of 1907 relating to the Laws and Customs of war on
land. I find that the interpretation prevailing among all continental
and some English and American authorities is contrary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to the old English rule, and I would respectfully ask to be informed
of the view which His Majesty's Government place upon the article
in question.</p>

<p>To give some idea as to how an interpretation of Article 23(h)
contrary to the old English rule prevails generally, I will quote
a number of French, German, English, and American writers, the
works of whom I have at hand in my library, and I will also quote
the German <i>Weissbuch</i> concerning the results of the second Hague
Conference of 1907.</p>

<p>Bonfils, <i>Manuel de droit international public</i>, 5th ed. by Fauchille,
1908, discusses, on page 651, the doctrine which denies to an enemy
subject any <i>persona standi in judicio</i>, but adds:&mdash;'... Article
23(h) d&eacute;cide qu'il est interdit de d&eacute;clarer &eacute;teints, suspendus ou
non recevables en justice, les droits et actions des nationaux de la
partie adverse.'</p>

<p>Politis, Professor of International Law in the University of Poitiers
(France), in his report to the Institute of International Law, Session
of Paris (1910), concerning <i>Effets de la Guerre sur les Obligations
Internationales et les Contrats priv&eacute;s</i>, page 18, says:</p>

<p>'Un point hors de doute, c'est, que la guerre ne peut, ni par
elle-m&ecirc;me ni par la volont&eacute; des bellig&eacute;rants, affecter la validit&eacute; ou
l'ex&eacute;cution des contrats ant&eacute;rieurs. Cette r&egrave;gle fait d&eacute;sormais
partie du droit positif. L'article 23(h) du nouveau R&egrave;glement
de la Haye interdit formellement aux bellig&eacute;rants "de d&eacute;clarer
&eacute;teints, suspendus ou non recevables en justice les droits et actions
des nationaux de la partie adverse."</p>

<p>'Cette formule condamne d'anciens usages conserv&eacute;s encore,
en partie, dans certains pays. Elle proscrit d'abord tous les moyens&mdash;annulation
ou confiscation&mdash;par lesquels on chercherait &agrave; atteindre,
dans leur existence, les droits n&eacute;s avant la guerre. Elle exclut,
en second lieu, l'ancienne pratique qui interdisait aux particuliers
ennemis l'acc&egrave;s des tribunaux. Elle prohibe, enfin, toutes les
mesures l&eacute;gislatives ou autres tendant &agrave; entraver au cours de la
guerre l'ex&eacute;cution ou les effets utiles des obligations priv&eacute;es,
notamment le cours des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts.</p>

<p>'Il y a l&agrave; progr&egrave;s incontestable. Et l'on doit &ecirc;tre reconnaissant
&agrave; la d&eacute;l&eacute;gation allemande &agrave; la 2e Conf&eacute;rence de la paix de l'avoir
provoqu&eacute;.</p>

<p>'L'accueil empress&eacute; et unanime qu'a re&ccedil;u cette heureuse initiative
permet d'esp&eacute;rer que de nouveaux progr&egrave;s pourront &ecirc;tre r&eacute;alis&eacute;s
dans cet ordre d'id&eacute;es.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>'On doit souhaiter que la disposition de l'article 23(h), &eacute;trang&egrave;re
&agrave; l'hypoth&egrave;se de l'occupation du territoire ennemi, soit distraite
du r&egrave;glement de 1907 (comme les articles 57 &agrave; 60 l'ont &eacute;t&eacute; du R&egrave;glement
de 1899) pour &ecirc;tre mieux plac&eacute;e dans une convention nouvelle,
o&ugrave; d'autres textes viendraient la compl&eacute;ter.'</p>

<p>Ullmann, <i>V&ouml;lkerrecht</i>, 2nd ed. 1908, p. 474, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Auch der Rechtsverkehr wird durch den Ausbruch des Krieges
nicht unterbrochen oder gehemmt. Die nach Landesrecht frueher
uebliche zeitweise Aufhebung der Klagbarkeit vom Schuldverbindlichkeiten
des Staates oder eines Angeh&ouml;rigen gegen Angeh&ouml;rige
des Feindes ist durch Artikel 23(h) untersagt.'</p>

<p>Wehberg, <i>Das Beuterecht im Land- und Seekriege</i>, 1909, pp. 5
and 6 says:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Article 46 Absatz 2 bestimmt:&mdash;"Das Privateigentum darf
nicht eingezogen werden." In konsequenter Durchf&uuml;hrung dieses
Satzes bestimmt der auf deutschen Antrag 1907 hinzugef&uuml;gte
Article 23(h):&mdash;"Untersagt ist die Aufhebung oder zeitweilige
Ausserkraftsetzung der Rechte und Forderungen von Angehoerigen
der Gegenpartei oder der Ausschliessung ihrer Klagbarkeit."'</p>

<p>Whittuck, <i>International Documents</i>, London 1908, Introduction
p. xxvii, says&mdash;'In Article 23(h) it is prohibited to declare abolished,
suspended or inadmissible in a court of law the rights and actions
of the nationals of the other belligerent which is a development
of the principle that the private property of the subjects of a belligerent
is not subject to confiscation. This new prohibition if accepted
by this country would necessitate some changes in our municipal
law.'</p>

<p>Holland, <i>The Laws of War on Land</i>, 1908, says on p. 5 that:&mdash;'Article
23(h) seems to require the Signatory Powers to the convention
concerned to legislate for the abolition of an enemy's disability
to sustain a <i>persona standi in judicio</i>.' (See also Holland,
<i>loco citato</i>, p. 44, where he expresses his doubts concerning the
interpretation of Article 23(h).)</p>

<p>Bordwell, <i>The Law of War between Belligerents</i>, Chicago 1908,
recognises on page 210 the fact that according to Article 23(h) an
alien enemy must now be allowed to sue in the courts of a belligerent,
and</p>

<p>Gregory, Professor in the University of Iowa, who reviews Bordwell's
work in the <i>American Journal of International Law</i>, Volume 3
(1909), page 788, takes up the same standpoint.</p>

<p>The only author who interprets Article 23(h) in a different way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
is General Davis, who in his <i>Elements of International Law</i>, 3rd
edition 1908, page 578, note 1, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>'It is more than probable that this humane and commendable
purpose would fail of accomplishment if a military commander
conceived it to be within his authority to suspend or nullify their
operation, or to regard their application in certain cases as a matter
falling within his administrative discretion. Especially is this
true where a military officer refuses to receive well grounded complaints,
or declines to receive demands for redress, in respect to the
acts or conduct of the troops under his command, from persons
subject to the jurisdiction of the enemy who find themselves, for
the time being, in the territory which he holds in military occupation.
To provide against such a contingency it was deemed wise to add an
appropriate declaratory clause to the prohibition of Article 23.'</p>

<p>It is very unfortunate that the book of General Davis is not at
all known on the Continent, and that therefore none of the continental
authors have any knowledge of the fact that a divergent
interpretation from their own of Article 23(h) is being preferred
by an American author.</p>

<p>It is likewise very unfortunate that neither the English Bluebook
on the Second Hague Peace Conference (see Parliamentary
Papers, Miscellaneous No. 4, 1907, page 104) nor the official minutes
of the proceedings of the Conference, edited by the Dutch Government,
give any such information concerning the construction of
Article 23(h) as could assist a jurist in forming an opinion regarding
the correct interpretation.</p>

<p>It is, however, of importance to take notice of the fact that Article
23(h) is an addition to Article 23 which was made on the proposition
of Germany, and that Germany prefers an interpretation of Article
23(h) which would seem to coincide with the interpretation preferred
by all the continental writers. This becomes clearly apparent
from the German <i>Weissbuch ueber die Ergebnisse der im Jahre 1907
in Haag abgehaltenen Friedensconferenz</i>, which contains on page 7
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Der Artikel 23 hat gleichfalls auf deutschen Antrag zwei wichtige
Zus&auml;tze erhalten. Durch den ersten wird der Grundsatz der Unverletzlichkeit
des Privateigenthumes auch auf dem Gebiete der Forderungsrechte
anerkannt. Nach der Gesetzgebung einzelner Staaten
soll n&auml;mlich der Krieg die Folge haben, dass die Schuldverbindlichkeiten
des Staates oder seiner Angeh&ouml;rigen gegen Angeh&ouml;rige
des Feindes aufgehoben oder zeitweilig ausser Kraft gesetzt oder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
wenigstens von der Klagbarkeit ausgeschlossen werden. Solche
Vorschriften werden nun durch den Artikel 23 Abs. 1 unter h f&uuml;r
unzul&auml;ssig erkl&auml;rt.'</p>

<p>However this may be, the details given above show sufficiently
that a divergent interpretation of Article 23(h) from the old English
rule is prevalent on the Continent, and is to some extent also accepted
by English and American Authorities, and it is for this reason that I
would ask whether His Majesty's Government consider that the old
English rule is no longer in force.</p>

<h4>LETTER FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE TO THE
PRESENT WRITER.</h4>

<div class="bk2"><p class="p5"><span class="smcap">Foreign Office</span>,</p>
<p class="td2"><i>March 27, 1911</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to thank you
for your letter of February 28th, and for drawing his attention
to the misconceptions which appear to prevail so largely among
the continental writers on international law with regard to the
purport and effect of Article 23(h) of the Convention of October 18th,
1907, respecting the laws and customs of war on land.</p>

<p>It seems very strange that jurists of the standing of those from
whose writings you quote could have attributed to the article in
question the meaning and effect they have given it if they had
studied the general scheme of the instrument in which it finds a
place.</p>

<p>The provision is inserted at the end of an article dealing with the
prohibited modes of warfare. It forms part of Chapter I. of Section
II. of the Regulations annexed to the Convention. The title of
Chapter I. is 'Means of injuring the enemy, sieges and bombardment':
and if the article itself is examined it will be seen to deal
with such matters as employing poison or poisoned weapons, refusing
quarter, use of treachery and the unnecessary destruction of private
property. Similarly the following articles (24 to 28) all deal with
the restrictions which the nations felt it incumbent upon them from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a sense of humanity to place upon the conduct of their armed forces
in the actual prosecution of military operations.</p>

<p>The Regulation in which these articles figure is itself merely
an annex to the Convention which alone forms the contractual
obligation between the parties, and the engagement which the
parties to the Convention have undertaken is (Article 1) to 'issue
instructions to their armed land forces in conformity with the
Regulations respecting the Law and Customs of war on land.'</p>

<p>This makes it abundantly clear that the purpose and scope of
the Regulations is limited to the proceedings of the armies in the
field; those armies are under the orders of the commanders, and
the Governments are bound to issue instructions to those commanders
to act in accordance with the Regulations. That is all. There is
nothing in the Convention or in the Regulations dealing with the
rights or the status of the non-combatant individuals, whether of
enemy nationality or domiciled in enemy territory. They are, of
course, if inhabitants of the theatre of war, affected by the provisions
of the Regulations because they are individuals who are
affected by the military operations, and in a sense a regulation which
forbids a military commander from poisoning a well gives a non-combatant
inhabitant a right or a quasi-right not to have his well
poisoned, but his rights against his neighbours, his relations with
private individuals, whether of his own or of enemy nationality,
remain untouched by this series of rules for the conduct of warfare
on land.</p>

<p>Turning now to the actual wording of Article 23(h) it will be
seen that it begins with the wording 'to declare.' It is particularly
forbidden 'to <i>declare</i> abolished, &amp;c.' This wording necessarily
contemplates the issue of some proclamation or notification purporting
to abrogate or to change rights previously existing and
which would otherwise have continued to exist, and in view of
Article I of the Convention this hypothetical proclamation must have
been one which it was assumed the commander of the army would
issue; consequently, stated broadly, the effect of Article 23(h) is
that a commander in the field is forbidden to attempt to terrorise
the inhabitants of the theatre of war by depriving them of existing
opportunities of obtaining relief to which they are entitled in respect
of private claims.</p>

<p>Sir E. Grey is much obliged to you for calling his attention to
the extract which you quote from the German White Book. This
extract may be translated as follows:&mdash;'Article 23 has also received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
on German proposal two weighty additions. By the first the fundamental
principle of the inviolability of private property in the
domain of legal claims is recognised. According to the legislation
of individual states, war has the result of extinguishing or temporarily
suspending, or at least of suppressing the liability of the state or its
nationals to be sued by nationals of the enemy. These prescriptions
have now been declared inadmissible by Article 23(h).'</p>

<p>The original form of the addition to Article 23 which the German
delegates proposed was as follows: 'de d&eacute;clarer &eacute;teintes, suspendues
ou non recevables les r&eacute;clamations priv&eacute;es de ressortissants de la
Partie adverse' (see proc&egrave;s-verbal of the 2nd meeting of the 1st
sub-Committee of the 2nd Committee, 10th July, 1907).</p>

<p>There is nothing to show that any explanation was vouchsafed
to the effect that the proposed addition to the article was intended
to mean more than its wording necessarily implied, though there
is a statement by one of the German delegates in the proc&egrave;s-verbal
of the 1st meeting of the 1st sub-Committee of the 2nd Committee,
on July 3rd, which in all probability must have referred to this
particular amendment, though the proc&egrave;s-verbal does not render
it at all clear; nor is the statement itself free from ambiguity. An
amendment was suggested and accepted at the second meeting to
add the words 'en justice' after 'non recevables,' and in this form
the sub-article was considered by an examining committee, was
accepted and incorporated in Article 23, and brought before and
accepted by the Conference in its 4th Plenary Sitting on the 17th
August, 1907.</p>

<p>The subsequent alteration in the wording must have been made
by the Drafting Committee, but cannot have been considered to
affect the substance of the provision, as in the 10th Plenary Sitting
on October 17th, 1907, the reporter of the Drafting Committee,
in dealing with the verbal amendments made in this Convention,
merely said, 'En ce qui concerne le r&egrave;glement lui-m&ecirc;me, je n'appellerai
pas votre attention sur les diff&eacute;rentes modifications de style sans
importance que nous y avons introduites.'</p>

<p>Nor is there anything to indicate any such far-reaching interpretation
as the German White Book suggests in the report which
accompanied the draft text of the Convention when it was brought
before the Plenary Sitting of the Conference (Annex A. to 4th
Plenary Sitting). It merely states that the addition is regarded as
embodying in very happy terms a consequence of the principles
accepted in 1899.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The result appears to Sir E. Grey to be that neither the wording
nor the context nor the circumstances attending the introduction
of the provision which now figures as Article 23(h) support the
interpretation which the writers you quote place upon it and which
the German White Book endorses.</p>

<p>Sir E. Grey notices that, in the extract you quote, Monsieur
Politis, after placing his own interpretation upon the article, remarks
that it is quite foreign to the hypothesis of the occupation
of territory and ought to be removed from the Regulations and
turned into a Convention by itself. If this interpretation were
correct, this remark of Monsieur Politis is certainly true: but the
fact that the provision appears where it does should have suggested
to Monsieur Politis that it does not bear the interpretation he puts
upon it.</p>

<p>Nor does it appear to Sir E. Grey that the provision conflicts with
the principle of the English common law that an enemy subject
is not entitled to bring an action in the courts to sustain a contract,
commerce with enemy subjects being illegal.</p>

<p>That principle operates automatically on the outbreak of war,
it requires no declaration by the Government, still less by a commander
in the field, to bring it into operation. It is a principle
which applies equally whether the war is being waged on land or
sea, and which is applied in all the courts and not merely in those
within the field of the operations of the military commanders.</p>

<p>The whole question of the effect of war upon the commerce of
private persons may require reconsideration in the future; the old
rules may be scarcely consistent with the requirements or the conditions
of modern commerce; but a modification of those rules is
not one to which His Majesty's Government could be a party except
after careful enquiry and consideration, and, when made at all,
it must be done by a convention that applies to war both on land
and sea.</p>

<p>They certainly have not become parties to any such modification
by agreeing to a convention which relates only to the instructions
they are to give the commanders of their armed forces, and which
is limited to war on land.</p>

<h3>THE LECTURE</h3>

<p>I. My last lecture dealt with the organisation of
a League of Nations and International Legislation
by the League. To-day I want to draw your attention
to International Administration of Justice and
International Mediation within the League.</p>

<p>I begin with International Administration of
Justice which, of course, is a question of International
Courts of Justice. Hitherto, although
International Legislation has been to some extent
in existence, no International Courts have been
established before which States in dispute have
been compelled to appear. Now there is no doubt
that International Legislation loses in value if there
are no arrangements for International Administration
of Justice by independent and permanent
International Courts. Yet it is incorrect to assert,
although it is frequently done, that one may not
speak of legislation and a law created by legislation
without the existence of Courts to administer such
law.</p>

<p>Why is this assertion incorrect? Because the
function of Courts is to decide <i>controversial</i> questions
of law or of fact in case the respective parties cannot
agree concerning them. However, in most cases
the law is not in jeopardy, and its commands are
carried out by those concerned without any necessity
for a Court to declare the law. Modern International
Law has been in existence for several hundred
years, and its commands have in most cases been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
complied with in the absence of International Courts.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that, if controversies
arise about a question of law or a question
of fact, the authority of the law can be successfully
vindicated only by the verdict of a Court. And
it is for this reason that no highly developed Community
can exist for long without Courts of Justice.</p>

<p>II. The Community of civilised States did not,
until the end of the nineteenth century, possess any
permanent institution which made the administration
of international justice possible. When States
were in conflict and, instead of having recourse to
arms, resolved to have the dispute peaceably settled
by an award, in every case they agreed upon so-called
arbitration, and they nominated one or more
arbitrators, whom they asked to give a verdict.
For this reason, it was an epoch-making step forward
when the First Peace Conference of 1899 agreed
upon the institution of a Permanent Court of Arbitration,
and a code of rules for the procedure before
this Court. Although the term 'Permanent Court
of Arbitration,' as applied to the institution
established by the First Hague Peace Conference,
is only a euphemism, since actually the Court concerned
is not a permanent one and the members of
the Court have in every case to be nominated by
the parties, there is in existence, firstly, a permanent
panel of persons from which the arbitrators may be
selected; secondly, a permanent office at the Hague;
and, thirdly, a code of procedure before the Court.
Thereby an institution has been established which
is always at hand in case the parties in conflict want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to make use of it; whereas in former times parties
in conflict had to negotiate a long time in order
to set up the machinery for arbitration. And the
short time of twenty years has fully justified
the expectations aroused by the institution of the
Permanent Court of Arbitration, for a good number
of cases have been brought before it and settled to
the satisfaction of the parties concerned.</p>

<p>And the Second Hague Peace Conference of 1907
contemplated further steps by agreeing upon a
treaty concerning the establishment of an International
Court of Appeal in Prize Cases, and upon
a draft treaty concerning a really Permanent
International Court of Justice side by side with
the existing Court of Arbitration. Although neither
of these contemplated International Courts has
been established, there is no doubt that, if after
the present war a League of Nations becomes a
reality, one or more International Courts of Justice
will surely be established, although the existing
Permanent Court of Arbitration may remain in
being.</p>

<p>III. But just as regards International Legislation,
I must warn you not to imagine that International
Administration of Justice by International
Courts is an easy matter. It is in fact full of
difficulties of many kinds.</p>

<p>The peculiar character of International Law;
the rivalry between the different schools of international
jurists, namely the Naturalists, Positivists,
and Grotians; the question of language; the
peculiarities of the systems of law of the different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
States, of their constitutions, and many other difficulties,
entail the danger that International Courts
may become the arena of national jealousies, of
empty talk, and of political intrigues, instead
of being pillars of international justice.</p>

<p>Everything depends upon what principles will
guide the States in their selection of the individuals
whom they appoint as members of International
Courts. Not diplomatists, not politicians, but only
men ought to be appointed who have had a training
in law in general, and in International Law in particular;
men who are linguists, knowing, at any
rate, the French language besides their own; men
who possess independence of character and are free
from national prejudices of every kind. There is
no doubt that, under present conditions and circumstances
of international life, the institution of International
Courts represents an unheard of experiment.
There is, however, likewise no doubt that <i>now</i> is
the time for the experiment to be made, and I believe
that the experiment will be successful, provided
the several States are careful in the appointment of
the judges.</p>

<p>IV. And it must be emphasised that an International
Court of Appeal above the one or several
International Courts is a necessity. Just as Municipal
Courts of Justice, so International Courts of
Justice are not infallible. If the States are to be
compelled to have their judicial disputes settled
by International Administration of Justice, there
must be a possibility of bringing an appeal from
lower International Courts to a Higher Court. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
only in this way that in time a body of International
Case Law can grow up, which will be equivalent
in its influence upon the practice of the States to
the municipal case law of the different States.</p>

<p>V. I have hitherto considered in a general way
only the difficulties of International Administration
of Justice; I have not touched upon the particular
difficulties connected with the setting up and manning
of International Courts. If the several States could
easily agree upon, say, five qualified men as judges
of a Court of First Instance, and upon, say, seven
qualified men as judges of a Court of Appeal, there
would be no difficulty whatever in setting up these
two Courts. And perhaps some generations hence
the time may come when such an agreement will
be possible. In our time it cannot be expected,
and here therefore lies the great difficulty in the
way of setting up and manning International Courts
of Justice; because there is no doubt that each State
will claim the right to appoint at least one man of
its own choice to sit as judge in the International
Court or Courts. And since there are about fifty
or more civilised independent States in existence,
the International Court would comprise fifty or
more members.</p>

<p>Now why would the several States claim a right
to appoint at least one man of their own choice as
judge? They would do this because they desire
to have a representative of their own general legal
views in the Court. It is a well-known fact that
not only the legal systems which prevail in the
several States differ, but also that there are differences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
concerning the fundamental conceptions of justice,
law, procedure, and evidence. Each State fears
that an International Court will create a practice
fundamentally divergent from its general legal
views, unless there is at least one representative of
its own general legal views sitting in the Court.</p>

<p>I think that in spite of everything the difficulty
is not insurmountable provided a scheme for an
International Court which follows closely the model
of Municipal Courts is not insisted upon. Just as
the organisation of a League of Nations cannot follow
the model of the organisation of a State, so the
attempt to set up an International Court must not
aim at following closely the model of Municipal
Courts. What is required is an institution which
secures the settlement of judicial international
disputes by giving judgments on the basis of law.
I think this demand can be satisfied by a scheme
which would meet both the claim of each State
to nominate one judge and the necessity not to
overcrowd the Bench which decides each dispute.</p>

<p>VI. The scheme which I should like to recommend
is one which distinguishes between the Court as a
whole and the several Benches which would be
called upon to decide the several cases. It is as
follows:</p>

<p>The Court as a whole to consist of as many judges
as there are members of the League, each member
to appoint one judge and one deputy judge who
would take the place of the judge in case of illness
or death or other cause of absence. The President,
the Vice-President, and, say, twelve or fourteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
members to constitute the Permanent Bench of the
Court and therefore to be resident the whole year
round at the Hague. Half of the members of this
Permanent Bench of the Court to be appointed by the
Great Powers&mdash;each Great Power to appoint one&mdash;and
the other half of the members to be appointed
by the minor Powers. Perhaps the Scandinavian
Powers might agree upon the nomination of one
member; Holland and Spain and Portugal upon
another; Belgium, Switzerland, and Luxemburg
upon a third; the Balkan States upon a fourth;
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile upon a fifth; and so on.
Anyhow, some arrangement would have to be made
according to which the minor Powers unite upon the
appointment of half the number of the Permanent
Bench.</p>

<p>If a judicial dispute arises between two States,
the case to go in the first instance before a Bench
comprising the two judges appointed by the two
States in dispute and a President who, as each case
arises, is to be selected by the Permanent Bench
of the Court from the members of this Bench. This
Court of First Instance having given its judgment,
each party to have a right of appeal. The appeal
to go before the Permanent Bench at the Hague,
which is to give judgment with a quorum of six
judges with the addition of those judges who served
as the Bench of First Instance. The right of appeal
to exist only on questions of law and not on questions
of fact.</p>

<p>Decisions of the Appeal Court to be binding precedents
for itself and for any Courts of First Instance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
But should the Appeal Court desire to go back on a
former decision of law, this to be possible only at
a meeting of the Court comprising at least twelve
members of the Permanent Bench.</p>

<p>VII. The proposal which I have just sketched,
and which will need to be worked out in detail if
it is to be realised, offers the following advantages:</p>

<p>Every case would in the first instance be decided
by a small Bench which would enjoy the confidence
of both parties because they would have their own
judge in the Court. This point is of particular importance
with regard to the mode of taking evidence
and making clear the facts; but is likewise of importance
on account of the divergence of fundamental
legal views and the like.</p>

<p>Since the Court of Appeal would only decide points
of law, the facts as elucidated by the Bench of First
Instance would remain settled. But the existence of
the Court of Appeal would enable the parties to re-argue
questions of law with all details. The fact that
six of the Bench which serves as a Court of Appeal
are members of the Permanent Bench would guarantee
a thorough reconsideration of the points of
law concerned, and likewise the maintenance and
sequence of tradition in International Administration
of Justice.</p>

<p>Again, the fact that the Court of Appeal is to
comprise, besides six members of the Permanent
Bench, those three judges who sat as the Bench
of First Instance would guarantee that the judges
appointed by the States in dispute could again bring
into play any particular views of law they may hold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>VIII. This is the outline of my scheme for the
establishment and manning of the International
Court of Justice. But before I leave the subject,
I must say a few words concerning two important
points which almost all other schemes for the establishment
of an International Court overlook. Firstly,
the necessity to make provision for what I should
like to call complex cases of dispute; namely, cases
which are justiciable but in which, besides the
question of law, there is at the same time involved
a vital political principle or claim. Take the case
of a South American State entering into an agreement
with a non-American State to lease to it a
coaling station: this case is justiciable, but besides
the question of law there is a political claim involved
in it, namely, the Monroe doctrine of the United
States. Unless provision be made for the settlement
of such complex cases, the League of Nations
will not be a success, for it might well happen that
a case touches vital political interests in such a way
as not to permit a State to have it settled by a mere
juristic decision.</p>

<p>Now my proposal to meet such complex cases is
that when a party objects to a settlement of a case
on mere juristic principles, although the other party
maintains that it is a justiciable case, the Bench
which is to serve as Bench of First Instance shall
investigate the matter with regard to the question
whether the case is more political than legal in
nature. If the Court decides the question in the
negative, then the same Court shall give judgment
on the dispute; but, if the Court decides the question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in the affirmative, then the case shall be referred by
the Court to the International Council of Conciliation.
Whatever the decision of the Bench of First
Instance may be, each party shall have the right of
appeal to the Permanent Bench which serves as the
Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>IX. The other point which I desire to mention
before I leave the subject of International Administration
of Justice concerns the notorious principle
<i>conventio omnis intelligitur rebus sic stantibus</i>. You
know that almost all publicists and also almost
all Governments assert the existence of a customary
rule according to which a vital change of circumstances
after ratification of a treaty may be of such
a kind as to justify a party in demanding to be
released either from the whole treaty or from certain
obligations stipulated in it. But the meaning of
the term 'vital change of circumstances' is elastic,
and there is therefore great danger that the principle
<i>conventio omnis intelligitur rebus sic stantibus</i> will
be abused for the purpose of hiding the violation
of treaties behind the shield of law. This danger
will remain so long as there is no International
Court in existence which, on the motion of one of
the contracting parties, could set aside the treaty
obligation whose fulfilment has become so oppressive
that in justice the obliged party might ask to be
released. Now, as the League of Nations is to set
up an International Court of Justice, my proposal
is that the Court should be declared competent to
give judgment on the claim of a party to a treaty
to be released from its obligations on account of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
vital change of circumstances. Of course the case
would go before that Bench of the Court which is to
serve as the Court of First Instance, and an appeal
would lie to the Permanent Bench which serves
as the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>X. Having given you the outlines of a scheme
concerning International Administration of Justice,
I now turn to International Mediation by International
Councils of Conciliation.</p>

<p>For a satisfactory proposal concerning International
Councils of Conciliation two starting points
offer themselves. One starting point is the special
form of mediation recommended by Article 8 of
the Hague Convention concerning the pacific settlement
of international disputes. The following is
the text of this Article 8:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The Signatory Powers are agreed in recommending the application,
when circumstances allow, of special mediation in the following
form:&mdash;</p>

<p>'In case of a serious difference endangering peace, the contending
States choose respectively a Power, to which they intrust the mission
of entering into direct communication with the Power chosen on
the other side, with the object of preventing the rupture of pacific
relations.</p>

<p>'For the period of this mandate, the term of which, in default
of agreement to the contrary, cannot exceed thirty days, the States
at variance cease from all direct communication on the subject of
the dispute, which is regarded as referred exclusively to the mediating
Powers. These Powers shall use their best efforts to settle the
dispute.</p>

<p>'In case of a definite rupture of pacific relations, these Powers
remain jointly charged with the task of taking advantage of any
opportunity to restore peace.'</p></div>

<p>The second starting point is supplied by the Permanent
International Commissions of the so-called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Bryan Peace Treaties concluded in 1913-14 by the
United States of America with a number of other
States. These peace treaties are not in every point
identical, but of interest to us here are the clauses
according to which Permanent International Commissions
are set up to serve as Councils of Conciliation.
The following is the text of the three articles
concerned of the treaty between the United States
and Great Britain of September 15, 1914:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Art. I. 'The High Contracting Parties agree that all disputes
between them, of every nature whatsoever, other than disputes the
settlement of which is provided for and in fact achieved under
existing agreements between the High Contracting Parties, shall,
when diplomatic methods of adjustment have failed, be referred for
investigation and report to a permanent International Commission,
to be constituted in the manner prescribed in the next succeeding
article; and they agree not to declare war or begin hostilities during
such investigation and before the report is submitted.'</p>

<p>Art. II. 'The International Commission shall be composed of
five members, to be appointed as follows: One member shall be
chosen from each country, by the Government thereof; one member
shall be chosen by each Government from some third country; the
fifth member shall be chosen by common agreement between the
two Governments, it being understood that he shall not be a citizen
of either country. The expenses of the Commission shall be paid
by the two Governments in equal proportions.'</p>

<p>'The International Commission shall be appointed within six
months after the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty; and
vacancies shall be filled according to the manner of the original
appointment.'</p>

<p>Art. III. 'In case the High Contracting Parties shall have failed
to adjust a dispute by diplomatic methods, they shall at once refer
it to the International Commission for investigation and report.
The International Commission may, however, spontaneously by
unanimous agreement offer its services to that effect, and in such
case it shall notify both Governments and request their co-operation
in the investigation.'</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Keeping in view the special form of mediation
recommended by Article 8 of the Hague Convention
concerning the Pacific Settlement of International
Disputes and the stipulations of the Bryan Peace
Treaties concerning Permanent International Commissions,
we can reach a satisfactory solution of
the problem of International Mediation if we take
into consideration the two reasons why a League of
Nations must stipulate the compulsion of its members
to bring non-justiciable disputes before a Council
of Conciliation previous to resorting to hostilities.
These reasons are, firstly, that war in future shall
not be declared without a previous attempt to have
the dispute peaceably settled, and, secondly, that
war in future shall not break out like a bolt from
the blue.</p>

<p>XI. My proposal concerning International Councils
of Conciliation is the following:</p>

<p>Every member of the League shall appoint for a
term of years&mdash;say five or ten&mdash;two conciliators
and two deputy conciliators from among their own
subjects, and one conciliator and one deputy conciliator
from among the subjects of some other
State. Now when a non-justiciable dispute arises
between two States which has not been settled by
diplomatic means, the three conciliators of each
party in dispute shall meet to investigate the matter,
to report thereon, and to propose, if possible, a
settlement.</p>

<p>According to this proposal there would be in
existence a number of Councils of Conciliation equal
to half the number of the members of the League.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Whenever a dispute arises, the Permanent Council
of Conciliation&mdash;with which I shall deal presently&mdash;shall
appoint a Chairman from amongst its own
members. The Council thus constituted shall investigate
the case, report on it, send a copy to
each party in dispute and to the Permanent Council
of Conciliation.</p>

<p>The <i>Permanent</i> Council of Conciliation should be
a <i>small</i> Council to be established by each of the
Great Powers appointing one conciliator and one
deputy conciliator for a period of&mdash;say&mdash;five or ten
years. The reason why only the Great Powers
should be represented in the Permanent Council of
Conciliation at the Hague is that naturally, in case
coercion is to be resorted to against a State which
begins war without having previously submitted the
dispute to a Council of Conciliation, the Great Powers
will be chiefly concerned. This Permanent Council
of Conciliation would have to watch the political
life of the members of the League and communicate
with all the Governments of the members in case
the peace of the world were endangered by the
attitude of one of the members; for instance by one
or more of the members arming excessively. The
Council would likewise be competent to draw the
attention of States involved in a dispute to the
fact that they ought to bring it before either the
International Court of Justice or their special Council
of Conciliation.</p>

<p>This proposal of mine concerning mediation within
the League of Nations is, of course, sketchy and
would need working out in detail if one were thinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of preparing a full plan for its realisation. However
that may be, my proposal concerning a number
of Councils of Conciliation has the advantage that
non-justiciable disputes would in each case be
investigated and reported on by conciliators who
have once for all been appointed by the States in
dispute and who therefore possess their confidence.
On the other hand, the proposed Permanent Council
of Conciliation would guarantee to the Great Powers
that important influence which is due to them on
account of the fact that they would be chiefly concerned
in case economic, military, or naval measures
had to be resorted to against a recalcitrant member
of the League.</p>

<p>XII. Having discussed International Mediation
by International Councils of Conciliation, I must
now turn to two questions which I have hitherto
purposely omitted, although in the eyes of many
people they stand in the forefront of interest,
namely, firstly, <i>disarmament</i> as a consequence of
the peaceable settlement of disputes by an International
Court of Justice and International Councils
of Conciliation, and, secondly, the question of the
<i>surrender of sovereignty</i> which it is asserted is involved
by the entrance of any State into the proposed
League of Nations.</p>

<p>Now as regards disarmament, I have deliberately
abstained from mentioning it hitherto, although it
is certainly a question of the greatest importance.
The reason for my abstention is a very simple one.
I have always maintained that disarmament can
neither diminish the number of wars nor abolish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
war altogether, but that, if the number of wars
diminishes or if war be abolished altogether, disarmament
will follow. There is no doubt that when
once the new League of Nations is in being, war will
occur much more rarely than hitherto. For this
reason disarmament will <i>ipso facto</i> follow the establishment
of a League of Nations, and the details
of such disarmament are matters which will soon
be solved when once the new League has become
a reality. Yet I must emphasise the fact that
disarmament is not identical with the total abolition
of armies and navies. The possibility must always
be kept in view that one or more members of the
League will be recalcitrant, and that then the other
members must unite their forces against them.
And there must likewise be kept in view the possibility
of a war between two members of the League
on account of a political dispute in which mediation
by the International Councils of Conciliation was
unsuccessful. Be that as it may, it is certain that
in time disarmament can take place to a very great
extent, and it is quite probable that large standing
armies based on conscription might everywhere be
abolished and be replaced by militia.</p>

<p>XIII. Let me now turn to the question of
sovereignty. Is the assertion really true that States
renounce their sovereignty by entering into the
League? The answer depends entirely upon the
conception of sovereignty with which one starts.
If sovereignty were absolutely unfettered liberty of
action, a loss of sovereignty would certainly be
involved by membership of the League, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
every member submits to the obligation never to
resort to arms on account of a judicial dispute, and
in case of a political dispute to resort to arms only
after having given an opportunity of mediation to
an International Council of Conciliation. But in
fact sovereignty does not mean absolutely boundless
liberty of action; and moreover sovereignty
has at no time been a conception upon the contents
of which there has been general agreement.</p>

<p>The term 'sovereignty' was introduced into political
science by Bodin in his celebrated work 'De
la R&eacute;publique,' which appeared in 1577. Before
that time, the word <i>souverain</i> was used in France
for any political or other authority which was not
subordinate to any higher authority; for instance,
the highest Courts were called <i>cours souveraines</i>.
Now Bodin gave quite a new meaning to the old
term. Being under the influence and in favour of
the policy of centralisation initiated by Louis XI
of France (1461-1483), the founder of French absolutism,
Bodin defines sovereignty as the 'absolute
and perpetual power within a State.' However,
even Bodin was far from considering sovereignty to
give absolutely unfettered freedom of action, for
he conceded that sovereignty was restricted by the
commandments of God and by the rules of the
Law of Nature. Be that as it may, this conception
of sovereignty once introduced was universally
accepted; but at the same time the meaning of
the term became immediately a bone of contention
between the schools of publicists. And it is to be
taken into consideration that the science of politics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
has learnt to distinguish between sovereignty of the
State and sovereignty of the agents who exercise
the sovereign powers of the State. According to
the modern view sovereignty is a natural attribute
of every independent State as a State; and
neither the monarch, nor Parliament, nor the people
can possess any sovereignty of their own. The
sovereignty of a monarch, or of a Parliament, or of
the whole people is not an original attribute of their
own, but derives from the sovereignty of the State
which is governed by them. It is outside the scope
of this lecture to give you a history of the conception
of sovereignty, it suffices to state the undeniable
fact that from the time when the term was first
introduced into political science until the present
day there has never been unanimity with regard
to its meaning, except that it is a synonym for
independence of all earthly authority.</p>

<p>Now, do you believe that the independence of a
State is really infringed because it agrees never to
make war on account of a judicial dispute, and in
case of a political dispute not to resort to arms before
having given opportunity of mediation to International
Councils of Conciliation? Independence
is not boundless liberty of a State to do what it
likes, without any restriction whatever. The mere
fact that there is an International Law in existence
restricts the unbounded liberty of action of every
civilised State, because every State is prohibited
from interfering with the affairs of every other State.
The fact is that the independence of every State
finds its limitation in the independence of every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
other State. And it is generally admitted that a
State can through conventions&mdash;such as a treaty
of alliance or of neutrality or others&mdash;enter into
many obligations which more or less restrict its
liberty of action. Independence is a question of
degree, and, therefore, it is also a question of degree
whether or no the independence of a State is vitally
encroached upon by a certain restriction. In my
opinion the independence of a State is as little
infringed by an agreement to submit all its judicial
disputes to the judgment of a Court and not to
resort to arms for a settlement, as the liberty of a
citizen is infringed because in a modern State he
can no longer resort to arms on account of a dispute
with a fellow citizen but must submit it to the
judgment of the Court.</p>

<p>And even if it were otherwise, if the entrance of
a State into the new League of Nations did involve
an infringement of its sovereignty and independence,
humanity need not grieve over it. The Prussian
conception of the State as an end in itself and of
the authority of the State as something above
everything else and divine&mdash;a conception which
found support in the philosophy of Hegel and his
followers&mdash;is adverse to the ideal of democracy
and constitutional government. Just as Henri IV
of France said 'La France vaut bien une messe,'
we may well say 'La paix du monde vaut bien la
perte de l'ind&eacute;pendance de l'&eacute;tat.'</p>

<p>XIV. I have come to the end of this course of
lectures, but before we part I should like, in conclusion,
to touch upon a question which has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
frequently been put with regard to the proposal of
a new League of Nations:&mdash;Can it really be expected
that, in case of a great conflict of interests, all the
members of the League will faithfully carry out
their engagements? Will the new League stand the
strain of such conflicts as shake the very existence
of States and Nations? Will the League really
stand the test of History?</p>

<p>History teaches that many a State has entered
into engagements with the intention of faithfully
carrying them out, but, when a grave conflict arose,
matters assumed a different aspect, with the consequence
that the engagements remained unfulfilled.
Will it be different in the future? Can the Powers
which enter into the League of Nations trust to the
security which it promises? Can they be prepared
to disarm, although there is no guarantee that,
when grave conflicts of vital interests arise, all
the members of the League will faithfully stand by
their engagements?</p>

<p>These are questions which it is difficult to
answer because no one can look into the future.
We can only say that, if really constitutional and
democratic government all the world over makes
international politics honest and reliable and excludes
secret treaties, all the chances are that the members
of the League will see that their true interests and
their lasting welfare are intimately connected with
the necessity of fulfilling the obligations to which
they have submitted by their entrance into the
League. The upheaval created by the present World
War, the many millions of lives sacrificed, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
enormous economic losses suffered during these years
of war, not only by the belligerents but also by all
neutrals, will be remembered for many generations
to come. It would therefore seem to be certain
that, while the memory of these losses in lives and
wealth lasts, all the members of the League will
faithfully carry out the obligations connected with
the membership of the League into which they enter
for the purpose of avoiding such a disaster as, like
a bolt from the blue, fell upon mankind by the
outbreak of the present war. On the other hand, I
will not deny that no one can guarantee the future;
that conflicts may arise which will shake the foundations
of the League of Nations; that the League may
fall to pieces; and that a disaster like the present
may again visit mankind. Our generation can only
do its best for the future, and it must be left to
succeeding generations to perpetuate the work
initiated by us.</p>
